.  UDP Read a datagram off the queue from one IP IF. 
.  Use the necessity for checksumming as an opportunity to
.  reassemble physically and release IP's dual-ported device
.  buffers. Leave the data distributed 16-bits per computer
.  word as in the dual-ported buffers. Some upper protocols
.  prefer it that way, such as XDR-RPC presentation. 
.
.  Upper protocols wanting the data packed into 24-bit computer
.  words will use the RECEIVE and  SEND socket calls.
.  IP has set TRANSPORT to address the first non-ip-header word,
.  and COUNT to equal IP datagram length minus IP header length,
.  both exclusive of any data replicated in an earlier datagram
.  fragment.

.  When the device buffer is given back to IP (proc IP$SELL), the
.  hardware is advised that the buffer in dual-ported device memory,
.  is free for further input ,possibly consolidated if adjacent to free heap,
.  and the detached descriptor, which is in system memory,
.  goes on a free chain.

.  These fields are not all used by UDP, but the descriptor is uniform
.  for all transport message buffers, both input and saved output.  
.
.  This is because buffers which are released not adjacent to free
.  heap top 
.
.  hardware is advised that the buffer is free for further input,
.  and the detached descriptor goes on a free chain.
